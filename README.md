# Frontend Developer Test - GitHub Readme
Welcome to the Frontend Developer Test for QuestionTime (QT)!

This repository contains the solution for the frontend application developed to interact with QT's backend APIs for managing questions.

## Problem Statement
QT is a SaaS platform that allows registered users to ask questions from the public. The backend engineers of QT have provided a set of APIs to support the frontend work. The goal of this test is to create a user-friendly interface for managing questions.

## Solution Overview
The solution involves creating a frontend application using Next.js. This application allows users to view existing questions, create new questions, and edit or delete existing ones. It interacts with the provided backend APIs to perform these operations.

## Technology Stack

**Framework: Next.js**

**Styling: TailwindCSS & DaisyUI**

**State Management: Redux Toolkit**


# Screens and Functionality

## Login/Token Request Screen
Displayed when the token doesn't exist.
Prompt the user to enter their email to request a token from the backend.

## Question Management Screen
Display existing questions and their options.
Provide a button to add new questions.
Allow removing or adding new options to questions.
Ensure the UI adheres to responsive design principles.
Deployment
The frontend application is deployed to a publicly accessible location for testing purposes. You can access the deployed application here (https://qt-test-talabidele.vercel.app).

## Implementation Notes

Utilize the provided OpenAPI documentation for more information about the API.
Ensure the application looks simple, nice, and responsive (good on mobile).
Make use of reusable components to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
Implement error handling and validation to provide a smooth user experience.
Test the application thoroughly to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Additional Considerations
Ensure code readability and follow best practices.
Write clear and concise commit messages.
Document any important design decisions or architectural choices made during development.
How to Run
To run the frontend application locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.

Install dependencies using ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```.

Start the development server using ```npm run dev``` or ```yarn dev```.

Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
